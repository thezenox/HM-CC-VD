A short look on the HomeMatic HM-CC-VD. Inside is a AtMega169PV and the CC1100 868Mhz wirelss module. H-bridge motor driver and a ir- refection sensor for incrematal position feedback. Pinout on the right PROG1 header (left to right): CLK VCC MISO MOSI RST GND
I will not continue developing an alternative firmware, just for information porpouse.
